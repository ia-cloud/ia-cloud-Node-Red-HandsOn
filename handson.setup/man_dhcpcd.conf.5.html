DHCPCD.CONF(5)                File Formats Manual               DHCPCD.CONF(5)

<strong>NAME</strong>
     <strong>dhcpcd.conf</strong> - dhcpcd configuration file

<strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>
     Although <strong>dhcpcd</strong> can do everything from the command line, there are cases
     where it's just easier to do it once in a configuration file.  Most of
     the options found in <a href="dhcpcd.8.html">dhcpcd(8)</a> can be used here.  The first word on the
     line is the option and the rest of the line is the value.  Leading and
     trailing whitespace for the option and value are trimmed.  You can escape
     characters in the value using the \ character.  Comments can be prefixed
     with the # character.  String values should be quoted with the "
     character.

     Here's a list of available options:

     <strong>allowinterfaces</strong> <span class="underline">pattern</span>
             When discovering interfaces, the interface name must match
             <span class="underline">pattern</span> which is a space or comma separated list of patterns
             passed to <a href="fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch(3)</a>.  If the same interface is matched in
             <strong>denyinterfaces</strong> then it is still denied.

     <strong>denyinterfaces</strong> <span class="underline">pattern</span>
             When discovering interfaces, the interface name must not match
             <span class="underline">pattern</span> which is a space or comma separated list of patterns
             passed to <a href="fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch(3)</a>.

     <strong>arping</strong> <span class="underline">address</span> [address]
             <strong>dhcpcd</strong> will arping each address in order before attempting DHCP.
             If an address is found, we will select the replying hardware
             address as the profile, otherwise the IP address.  Example:

                   interface bge0
                   arping 192.168.0.1

                   # My specific 192.168.0.1 network
                   profile dd:ee:aa:dd:bb:ee
                   static ip_address=192.168.0.10/24

                   # A generic 192.168.0.1 network
                   profile 192.168.0.1
                   static ip_address=192.168.0.98/24

     <strong>authprotocol</strong> <span class="underline">protocol</span> [<span class="underline">algorithm</span> [<span class="underline">rdm</span>]]
             Authenticate DHCP messages.  See the Supported Authentication
             Protocols section.  If <span class="underline">protocol</span> is <span class="underline">token</span> then <span class="underline">algorithm</span> <span class="underline">is</span>
             snd_secretid/rcv_secretid so you can send and recieve different
             tokens.

     <strong>authtoken</strong> <span class="underline">secretid</span> <span class="underline">realm</span> <span class="underline">expire</span> <span class="underline">key</span>
             Define a shared key for use in authentication.  <span class="underline">realm</span> can be ""
             to for use with the <span class="underline">delayed</span> protocol.  <span class="underline">expire</span> is the date the
             token expires and should be formatted "yyy-mm-dd HH:MM".  You can
             use the keyword <span class="underline">forever</span> or <span class="underline">0</span> which means the token never expires.
             For the token protocol, <span class="underline">secretid</span> needs to be 0 and <span class="underline">realm</span> needs to
             be "".  If <strong>dhcpcd</strong> has the error
                   dhcp_auth_encode: Invalid argument
             then it means that <strong>dhcpcd</strong> could not find the correct
             authentication token in your configuration.

     <strong>background</strong>
             Fork to the background immediately.  This is useful for startup
             scripts which don't disable link messages for carrier status.

     <strong>blacklist</strong> <span class="underline">address</span>[/cidr]
             Ignores all packets from <span class="underline">address</span>[/cidr].

     <strong>whitelist</strong> <span class="underline">address</span>[/cidr]
             Only accept packets from <span class="underline">address</span>[/cidr].  <strong>blacklist</strong> is ignored if
             <strong>whitelist</strong> is set.

     <strong>bootp</strong>   Be a BOOTP client.  Basically, this just doesn't send a DHCP
             Message Type option and will only interact with a BOOTP server.
             All other DHCP options still work.

     <strong>broadcast</strong>
             Instructs the DHCP server to broadcast replies back to the
             client.  Normally this is only set for non-Ethernet interfaces,
             such as FireWire and InfiniBand.  In most cases, <strong>dhcpcd</strong> will set
             this automatically.

     <strong>controlgroup</strong> <span class="underline">group</span>
             Sets the group ownership of <span class="underline">/var/run/dhcpcd.sock</span> so that users
             other than root can connect to <strong>dhcpcd</strong>.

     <strong>debug</strong>   Echo debug messages to the stderr and syslog.

     <strong>dev</strong> <span class="underline">value</span>
             Load the <span class="underline">value</span> <span class="underline">/dev</span> management module.  <strong>dhcpcd</strong> will load the
             first one found to work, if any.

     <strong>env</strong> <span class="underline">value</span>
             Push <span class="underline">value</span> to the environment for use in <a href="dhcpcd-run-hooks.8.html">dhcpcd-run-hooks(8)</a>.
             For example, you can force the hostname hook to always set the
             hostname with <strong>env</strong> <span class="underline">force_hostname=YES</span>.  Or set which driver
             <a href="wpa_supplicant.8.html">wpa_supplicant(8)</a> should use with <strong>env</strong>
             <span class="underline">wpa_supplicant_driver=nl80211</span>

             If the hostname is set, it will be will set to the FQDN if
             possible as per RFC 4702, section 3.1.  If the FQDN option is
             missing, <strong>dhcpcd</strong> will still try and set a FQDN from the hostname
             and domain options for consistency.  To override this, set <strong>env</strong>
             <span class="underline">hostname_fqdn=[YES|NO|SERVER]</span>.  A value of <span class="underline">SERVER</span> means just what
             the server says, don't manipulate it.  This could lead to an
             inconsistent hostname on a DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 network where the
             DHCPv4 hostname is short and the DHCPv6 has an FQDN.  DHCPv6 has
             no hostname option.

     <strong>clientid</strong> <span class="underline">string</span>
             Send the <span class="underline">clientid</span>.  If the string is of the format 01:02:03 then
             it is encoded as hex.  For interfaces whose hardware address is
             longer than 8 bytes, or if the <span class="underline">clientid</span> is an empty string then
             <strong>dhcpcd</strong> sends a default <span class="underline">clientid</span> of the hardware family and the
             hardware address.

     <strong>duid</strong>    Use a DHCP Unique Identifier.  If a system UUID is available,
             that will be used to create a DUID-UUID, otheriwse if persistent
             storage is available then a DUID-LLT (link local address + time)
             is generated, otherwise DUID-LL is generated (link local
             address).  This, plus the IAID will be used as the <strong>clientid</strong>.  The
             DUID generated will be held in <span class="underline">/var/db/dhcpcd/duid</span> and should not
             be copied to other hosts.  This file also takes precedence over
             the above rules.

     <strong>iaid</strong> <span class="underline">iaid</span>
             Set the Interface Association Identifier to <span class="underline">iaid</span>.  This option
             must be used in an <strong>interface</strong> block.  This defaults to the VLANID
             (prefixed with 0xff) for the interface if set, otherwise the last
             4 bytes of the hardware address assigned to the interface.  Each
             instance of this should be unique within the scope of the client
             and <strong>dhcpcd</strong> warns if a conflict is detected.  If there is a
             conflict, it is only a problem if the conflicted IAIDs are used
             on the same network.

     <strong>dhcp</strong>    Enable DHCP on the interface, on by default.

     <strong>dhcp6</strong>   Enable DHCPv6 on the interface, on by default.

     <strong>ipv4</strong>    Enable IPv4 on the interface, on by default.

     <strong>ipv6</strong>    Enable IPv6 on the interface, on by default.

     <strong>request</strong> [<span class="underline">address</span>]
             Request the <span class="underline">address</span> in the DHCP DISCOVER message.  There is no
             guarantee this is the address the DHCP server will actually give.
             If no <span class="underline">address</span> is given then the first address currently assigned
             to the <span class="underline">interface</span> is used.

     <strong>inform</strong> [<span class="underline">address</span>[<span class="underline">/cidr</span>[<span class="underline">/broadcast_address</span>]]]
             Behaves like <strong>request</strong> as above, but sends a DHCP INFORM instead of
             DISCOVER/REQUEST.  This does not get a lease as such, just
             notifies the DHCP server of the <span class="underline">address</span> in use.  You should also
             include the optional <span class="underline">cidr</span> network number in case the address is
             not already configured on the interface.  <strong>dhcpcd</strong> remains running
             and pretends it has an infinite lease.  <strong>dhcpcd</strong> will not de-
             configure the interface when it exits.  If <strong>dhcpcd</strong> fails to
             contact a DHCP server then it returns a failure instead of
             falling back on IPv4LL.

     <strong>inform6</strong>
             Performs a DHCPv6 Information Request.  No address is requested
             or specified, but all other DHCPv6 options are allowed.  This is
             normally performed automatically when an IPv6 Router
             Advertisement indicates that the client should perform this
             operation.  This option is only needed when <strong>dhcpcd</strong> is not
             processing IPv6 RA messages and the need for a DHCPv6 Information
             Request exists.

     <strong>persistent</strong>
             <strong>dhcpcd</strong> normally de-configures the interface and configuration
             when it exits.  Sometimes, this isn't desirable if, for example,
             you have root mounted over NFS or SSH clients connect to this
             host and they need to be notified of the host shutting down.  You
             can use this option to stop this from happening.

     <strong>fallback</strong> <span class="underline">profile</span>
             Fall back to using this profile if DHCP fails.  This allows you
             to configure a static profile instead of using ZeroConf.

     <strong>hostname</strong> <span class="underline">name</span>
             Sends the hostname <span class="underline">name</span> to the DHCP server so it can be
             registered in DNS.  If <span class="underline">name</span> is an empty string then the current
             system hostname is sent.  If <span class="underline">name</span> is a FQDN (i.e., contains a .)
             then it will be encoded as such.

     <strong>hostname_short</strong>
             Sends the short hostname to the DHCP server instead of the FQDN.
             This is useful because DHCP servers will not register the FQDN in
             their DNS if the domain part does not match theirs.

             Also, see the <strong>env</strong> option above to control how the hostname is set
             on the host.

     <strong>ia_na</strong> [<span class="underline">iaid</span> [/ address]]
             Request a DHCPv6 Normal Address for <span class="underline">iaid</span>.  <span class="underline">iaid</span> defaults to the
             <strong>iaid</strong> option as described above.  You can request more than one
             ia_na by specifying a unique <span class="underline">iaid</span> for each one.

     <strong>ia_ta</strong> [<span class="underline">iaid</span>]
             Request a DHCPv6 Temporary Address for <span class="underline">iaid</span>.  You can request
             more than one ia_ta by specifying a unique <span class="underline">iaid</span> for each one.

     <strong>ia_pd</strong> [<span class="underline">iaid</span> [/ <span class="underline">prefix</span> <span class="underline">/</span> <span class="underline">prefix_len</span>] [<span class="underline">interface</span> [/ <span class="underline">sla_id</span> [/ <span class="underline">prefix_len</span> [/
             <span class="underline">suffix</span>]]]]]
             Request a DHCPv6 Delegated Prefix for <span class="underline">iaid</span>.  This option must be
             used in an <strong>interface</strong> block.  Unless a <span class="underline">sla_id</span> of 0 is assigned
             with the same resultant prefix length as the delegation, a reject
             route is installed for the Delegated Prefix to stop unallocated
             addresses being resolved upstream.  If no <span class="underline">interface</span> is given then
             we will assign a prefix to every other interface with a <span class="underline">sla_id</span>
             equivalent to the interface index assigned by the OS.  Otherwise
             addresses are only assigned for each <span class="underline">interface</span> and <span class="underline">sla_id</span>.  Each
             assigned address will have a <span class="underline">suffix</span>, defaulting to 1.  If the
             <span class="underline">suffix</span> is 0 then a SLAAC address is assigned.  You cannot assign
             a prefix to the requesting interface unless the DHCPv6 server
             supports the RFC 6603 Prefix Exclude Option.  <strong>dhcpcd</strong> has to be
             running for all the interfaces it is delegating to.  A default
             <span class="underline">prefix_len</span> of 64 is assumed, unless the maximum <span class="underline">sla_id</span> does not
             fit.  In this case <span class="underline">prefix_len</span> is increased to the highest
             multiple of 8 that can accommodate the <span class="underline">sla_id</span>.  <span class="underline">sla_id</span> is an
             integer which must be unique inside the <span class="underline">iaid</span> and is added to the
             prefix which must fit inside <span class="underline">prefix_len</span> less the length of the
             delegated prefix.  You can specify multiple <span class="underline">interface</span> <span class="underline">/</span> <span class="underline">sla_id</span> <span class="underline">/</span>
             <span class="underline">prefix_len</span> per <strong>ia_pd</strong>, space separated.  IPv6RS should be disabled
             globally when requesting a Prefix Delegation.

             In the following example eth0 is the externally facing interface
             to be configured for both IPv4 and IPv6.  The DHCPv4 server will
             provide us with an IPv4 address and a default route.  The DHCPv6
             server is going to provide us with an IPv6 address, a default
             route and a /64 subnet to be delegated to the internal interface.
             The eth1 interface will be automatically configured for IPv6
             using the first address (::1) from the delegated prefix.  A
             second prefix is requested and assigned to two other interfaces.
             <a href="rtadvd.8.html">rtadvd(8)</a> can be used with an empty configuration file on eth1,
             eth2 and eth3, to provide automatic IPv6 address configuration
             for the internal network.

             noipv6rs                 # disable routing solicitation
             denyinterfaces eth2      # Don't touch eth2 at all
             interface eth0
               ipv6rs                 # enable routing solicitation for eth0
               ia_na 1                # request an IPv6 address
               ia_pd 2 eth1/0         # request a PD and assign it to eth1
               ia_pd 3 eth2/1 eth3/2  # req a PD and assign it to eth2 and eth3

     <strong>ipv4only</strong>
             Only configure IPv4.

     <strong>ipv6only</strong>
             Only configure IPv6.

     <strong>fqdn</strong> [disable | none | ptr | both]
             <span class="underline">none</span> will not ask the DHCP server to update DNS.  <span class="underline">ptr</span> just asks
             the DHCP server to update the PTR record of the host in DNS,
             whereas <span class="underline">both</span> also updates the A record.  <span class="underline">disable</span> will disable the
             FQDN option.  The default is <span class="underline">both</span>.  <strong>dhcpcd</strong> itself never does any
             DNS updates.  <strong>dhcpcd</strong> encodes the FQDN hostname as specified in
             RFC 1035.

     <strong>interface</strong> <span class="underline">interface</span>
             Subsequent options are only parsed for this <span class="underline">interface</span>.

     <strong>ipv6ra_autoconf</strong>
             Generate SLAAC addresses for each Prefix advertised by an IPv6
             Router Advertisement message with the Auto flag set.  On by
             default.

     <strong>ipv6ra_noautoconf</strong>
             Disables the above option.

     <strong>ipv6ra_fork</strong>
             By default, when <strong>dhcpcd</strong> receives an IPv6 Router Advertisement,
             <strong>dhcpcd</strong> will only fork to the background if the RA contains at
             least one unexpired RDNSS option and a valid prefix or no DHCPv6
             instruction.  Set this option so to make <strong>dhcpcd</strong> always fork on an
             RA.

     <strong>ipv6rs</strong>  Enables IPv6 Router Advertisement solicitation.  This is on by
             default, but is documented here in the case where it is disabled
             globally but needs to be enabled for one interface.

     <strong>leasetime</strong> <span class="underline">seconds</span>
             Request a leasetime of <span class="underline">seconds</span>.

     <strong>logfile</strong> <span class="underline">logfile</span>
             Writes to the specified <span class="underline">logfile</span> rather than <a href="syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a>.  The
             <span class="underline">logfile</span> is reopened when <strong>dhcpcd</strong> receives the SIGUSR2 signal.

     <strong>metric</strong> <span class="underline">metric</span>
             Metrics are used to prefer an interface over another one, lowest
             wins.  <strong>dhcpcd</strong> will supply a default metric of 200 +
             <a href="if_nametoindex.3.html">if_nametoindex(3)</a>.  An extra 100 will be added for wireless
             interfaces.

     <strong>mudurl</strong> <span class="underline">url</span>
             Specifies the URL for a Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD).
             The description is used by upstream network devices to
             instantiate any desired access lists.  See draft-ietf-opsawg-mud
             for more information.

     <strong>noalias</strong>
             Any pre-existing IPv4 addresses will be removed from the
             interface when adding a new IPv4 address.

     <strong>noarp</strong>   Don't send any ARP requests.  This also disables IPv4LL.

     <strong>noauthrequired</strong>
             Don't require authentication even though we requested it.  Also
             allows FORCERENEW and RECONFIGURE messages without
             authentication.

     <strong>nodelay</strong>
             Don't delay for an initial randomised time when starting
             protocols.

     <strong>nodev</strong>   Don't load <span class="underline">/dev</span> management modules.

     <strong>nodhcp</strong>  Don't start DHCP or listen to DHCP messages.  This is only useful
             when allowing IPv4LL.

     <strong>nodhcp6</strong>
             Don't start DHCPv6 or listen to DHCPv6 messages.  Normally DHCPv6
             is started by an IPv6 Router Advertisement instruction or
             configuration.

     <strong>nogateway</strong>
             Don't install any default routes.

     <strong>gateway</strong>
             Install a default route if available (default).

     <strong>nohook</strong> <span class="underline">script</span>
             Don't run this hook script.  Matches full name, or prefixed with
             2 numbers optionally ending with <span class="underline">.sh</span>.

             So to stop <strong>dhcpcd</strong> from touching your DNS settings or starting
             wpa_supplicant you would do:-
                   nohook resolv.conf, wpa_supplicant

     <strong>noipv4</strong>  Don't attempt to configure an IPv4 address.

     <strong>noipv4ll</strong>
             Don't attempt to obtain an IPv4LL address if we failed to get one
             via DHCP.  See <span class="underline">RFC</span> <span class="underline">3927</span>.

     <strong>noipv6</strong>  Don't solicit or accept IPv6 Router Advertisements and DHCPv6.

     <strong>noipv6rs</strong>
             Don't solicit or accept IPv6 Router Advertisements.

     <strong>nolink</strong>  Don't receive link messages about carrier status.  You should
             only set this for buggy interface drivers.

     <strong>noup</strong>    Don't bring the interface up when in master mode.  If <strong>dhcpcd.conf</strong>
             cannot determine the carrier state, <strong>dhcpcd.conf</strong> will enter a
             tight polling loop until the interface is marked up and running
             or a valid carrier state is reported.

     <strong>option</strong> <span class="underline">option</span>
             Requests the <span class="underline">option</span> from the server.  It can be a variable to be
             used in <a href="dhcpcd-run-hooks.8.html">dhcpcd-run-hooks(8)</a> or the numerical value.  You can
             specify more <span class="underline">option</span>s separated by commas, spaces or more <strong>option</strong>
             lines.  Prepend dhcp6_ to <span class="underline">option</span> to request a DHCPv6 option.  If
             no DHCPv6 options are configured, then DHCPv4 options are mapped
             to equivalent DHCPv6 options.

             Prepend nd_ to <span class="underline">option</span> to handle ND options, but this only works
             for the <strong>nooption</strong>, <strong>reject</strong> and <strong>require</strong> options.

             To see a list of options you can use, call <strong>dhcpcd</strong> with the <strong>-V</strong>,
             <strong>--variables</strong> argument.

     <strong>nooption</strong> <span class="underline">option</span>
             Remove the option from the message before it's processed.

     <strong>require</strong> <span class="underline">option</span>
             Requires the <span class="underline">option</span> to be present in all messages, otherwise the
             message is ignored.  To enforce that <strong>dhcpcd</strong> only responds to DHCP
             servers and not BOOTP servers, you can <strong>require</strong> <span class="underline">dhcp_message_type</span>.
             This isn't an exact science though because a BOOTP server can
             send DHCP-like options.

     <strong>reject</strong> <span class="underline">option</span>
             Reject a message that contains the <span class="underline">option</span>.  This is useful when
             you cannot use <strong>require</strong> to select / de-select BOOTP messages.

     <strong>destination</strong> <span class="underline">option</span>
             If <strong>dhcpcd.conf</strong> detects an address added to a point to point
             interface (PPP, TUN, etc) then it will set the listed DHCP
             options to the destination address of the interface.

     <strong>profile</strong> <span class="underline">name</span>
             Subsequent options are only parsed for this profile <span class="underline">name</span>.

     <strong>quiet</strong>   Suppress any dhcpcd output to the console, except for errors.

     <strong>reboot</strong> <span class="underline">seconds</span>
             Allow <span class="underline">reboot</span> seconds before moving to the DISCOVER phase if we
             have an old lease to use and moving from DISCOVER to IPv4LL if no
             reply.  The default is 5 seconds.  A setting of 0 seconds causes
             <strong>dhcpcd</strong> to skip the REBOOT phase and go straight into DISCOVER.
             This is desirable for mobile users because if you change from
             network A to network B and they use the same subnet and the
             address from network A isn't in use on network B, then the DHCP
             server will remain silent even if authoritative which means
             <strong>dhcpcd</strong> will timeout before moving back to the DISCOVER phase.

     <strong>release</strong>
             <strong>dhcpcd</strong> will release the lease prior to stopping the interface.

     <strong>script</strong> <span class="underline">script</span>
             Use <span class="underline">script</span> instead of the default <span class="underline">/libexec/dhcpcd-run-hooks</span>.

     <strong>ssid</strong> <span class="underline">ssid</span>
             Subsequent options are only parsed for this wireless <span class="underline">ssid</span>.

     <strong>slaac</strong> [<span class="underline">hwaddr</span> | <span class="underline">private</span>]
             Selects the interface identifier used for SLAAC generated IPv6
             addresses.  If <span class="underline">private</span> is used, an RFC 7217 address is generated.

     <strong>static</strong> <span class="underline">value</span>
             Configures a static <span class="underline">value</span>.  If you set <strong>ip_address</strong> then <strong>dhcpcd</strong>
             will not attempt to obtain a lease and will just use the value
             for the address with an infinite lease time.  If you set
             <strong>ip6_address</strong>, <strong>dhcpcd</strong> will continue auto-configuation as normal.

             Here is an example which configures two static address,
             overriding the default IPv4 broadcast address, an IPv4 router,
             DNS and disables IPv6 auto-configuration.  You could also use the
             <strong>inform6</strong> command here if you wished to obtain more information via
             DHCPv6.  For IPv4, you should use the <strong>inform</strong> <span class="underline">ipaddress</span> option
             instead of setting a static address.
                   interface eth0
                   noipv6rs
                   static ip_address=192.168.0.10/24
                   static broadcast_address=192.168.0.63
                   static ip6_address=fd51:42f8:caae:d92e::ff/64
                   static routers=192.168.0.1
                   static domain_name_servers=192.168.0.1
                   fd51:42f8:caae:d92e::1

             Here is an example for PPP which gives the destination a default
             route.  It uses the special <span class="underline">destination</span> keyword to insert the
             destination address into the value.
                   interface ppp0
                   static ip_address=
                   destination routers

     <strong>timeout</strong> <span class="underline">seconds</span>
             Time out after <span class="underline">seconds</span>, instead of the default 30.  A setting of
             0 <span class="underline">seconds</span> causes <strong>dhcpcd</strong> to wait forever to get a lease.  If
             <strong>dhcpcd</strong> is working on a single interface then <strong>dhcpcd</strong> will exit
             when a timeout occurs, otherwise <strong>dhcpcd</strong> will fork into the
             background.  If using IPv4LL then <strong>dhcpcd</strong> start the IPv4LL process
             after the timeout and then wait a little longer before really
             timing out.

     <strong>userclass</strong> <span class="underline">string</span>
             Tag the DHCPv4 messages with the userclass.  You can specify more
             than one.

     <strong>vendor</strong> <span class="underline">code</span>,<span class="underline">value</span>
             Add an encapsulated vendor option.  <span class="underline">code</span> should be between 1 and
             254 inclusive.  To add a raw vendor string, omit <span class="underline">code</span> but keep
             the comma.  Examples.

             Set the vendor option 01 with an IP address.
                   vendor 01,192.168.0.2
             Set the vendor option 02 with a hex code.
                   vendor 02,01:02:03:04:05
             Set the vendor option 03 with an IP address as a string.
                   vendor 03,\"192.168.0.2\"
             Set un-encapsulated vendor option to hello world.
                   vendor ,"hello world"

     <strong>vendorclassid</strong> <span class="underline">string</span>
             Set the DHCP Vendor Class.  DHCPv6 has its own option as shown
             below.  The default is
             dhcpcd-&lt;version&gt;:&lt;os&gt;:&lt;machine&gt;:&lt;platform&gt;.  For example
                   dhcpcd-5.5.6:NetBSD-6.99.5:i386:i386
             If not set then none is sent.  Some badly configured DHCP servers
             reject unknown vendorclassids.  To work around it, try and
             impersonate Windows by using the MSFT vendorclassid.

     <strong>vendclass</strong> <span class="underline">en</span> <span class="underline">data</span>
             Add the DHCPv6 Vendor Indetifying Vendor Class with the IANA
             assigned Enterprise Number <span class="underline">en</span> with the <span class="underline">data</span>.  This option can be
             set more than once to add more data, but the behaviour, as per
             RFC(3925) is undefined if the Enterprise Number differs.

     <strong>waitip</strong> [4 | 6]
             Wait for an address to be assigned before forking to the
             background.  4 means wait for an IPv4 address to be assigned.  6
             means wait for an IPv6 address to be assigned.  If no argument is
             given, <strong>dhcpcd.conf</strong> will wait for any address protocol to be
             assigned.  It is possible to wait for more than one address
             protocol and <strong>dhcpcd.conf</strong> will only fork to the background when
             all waiting conditions are satisfied.

     <strong>xidhwaddr</strong>
             Use the last four bytes of the hardware address as the DHCP xid
             instead of a randomly generated number.

   <strong>Defining</strong> <strong>new</strong> <strong>options</strong>
     DHCP, ND and DHCPv6 allow for the use of custom options, and RFC 3925
     vendor options for DHCP can also be supplied.  Each option needs to be
     started with the <strong>define</strong>, <strong>definend,</strong> <strong>define6</strong> or <strong>vendopt</strong> directive.  This
     can optionally be followed by both <strong>embed</strong> or <strong>encap</strong> options.  Both can be
     specified more than once and <strong>embed</strong> must come before <strong>encap</strong>.

     <strong>define</strong> <span class="underline">code</span> <span class="underline">type</span> <span class="underline">variable</span>
             Defines the DHCP option <span class="underline">code</span> of <span class="underline">type</span> with a name of <span class="underline">variable</span>
             exported to <a href="dhcpcd-run-hooks.8.html">dhcpcd-run-hooks(8)</a>.

     <strong>definend</strong> <span class="underline">code</span> <span class="underline">type</span> <span class="underline">variable</span>
             Defines the ND option <span class="underline">code</span> of <span class="underline">type</span> with a name of <span class="underline">variable</span>
             exported to <a href="dhcpcd-run-hooks.8.html">dhcpcd-run-hooks(8)</a>, with a prefix of <span class="underline">_nd</span>.

     <strong>define6</strong> <span class="underline">code</span> <span class="underline">type</span> <span class="underline">variable</span>
             Defines the DHCPv6 option <span class="underline">code</span> of <span class="underline">type</span> with a name of <span class="underline">variable</span>
             exported to <a href="dhcpcd-run-hooks.8.html">dhcpcd-run-hooks(8)</a>, with a prefix of <span class="underline">_dhcp6</span>.

     <strong>vendopt</strong> <span class="underline">code</span> <span class="underline">type</span> <span class="underline">variable</span>
             Defines the Vendor-Identifying Vendor Options.  The <span class="underline">code</span> is the
             IANA Enterprise Number which will uniquely describe the
             encapsulated options.  <span class="underline">type</span> is normally <span class="underline">encap</span>.  <span class="underline">variable</span> names
             the Vendor option to be exported.

     <strong>embed</strong> <span class="underline">type</span> <span class="underline">variable</span>
             Defines an embedded variable within the defined option.  The
             length is determined by the <span class="underline">type</span>.  If the <span class="underline">variable</span> is not the
             same as defined in the parent option, it is prefixed with the
             parent <span class="underline">variable</span> first with an underscore.  If the <span class="underline">variable</span> has
             the name of <span class="underline">reserved</span> then it is not processed.

     <strong>encap</strong> <span class="underline">code</span> <span class="underline">type</span> <span class="underline">variable</span>
             Defines an encapsulated variable within the defined option.  The
             length is determined by the <span class="underline">type</span>.  If the <span class="underline">variable</span> is not the
             same as defined in the parent option, it is prefixed with the
             parent <span class="underline">variable</span> first with an underscore.

   <strong>Type</strong> <strong>prefix</strong>
     These keywords come before the type itself, to describe it more fully.
     You can use more than one, but they must appear in the order listed
     below.

     <strong>request</strong>  Requests the option by default without having to be specified in
              user configuration.

     <strong>norequest</strong>
              This option cannot be requested, regardless of user
              configuration.

     <strong>optional</strong>
              This option is optional.  Only makes sense for embedded options
              like the client FQDN option, where the FQDN string itself is
              optional.

     <strong>index</strong>    The option can appear more than once and will be indexed.

     <strong>array</strong>    The option data is split into a space separated array, each
              element being the same type.

   <strong>Types</strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong>define</strong>
     The type directly affects the length of data consumed inside the option.
     Any remaining data is normally discarded.  Lengths can be specified for
     string and binhex types, but this is generally with other data embedded
     afterwards in the same option.

     <strong>ipaddress</strong>
             An IPv4 address, 4 bytes.

     <strong>ip6address</strong>
             An IPv6 address, 16 bytes.

     <strong>string</strong> [: <strong>length</strong>]
             A NVT ASCII string of printable characters.

     <strong>byte</strong>    A byte.

     <strong>bitflags</strong>: <strong>flags</strong>
             A byte represented as a string of flags, most significant bit
             first.  For example, using ABCDEFGH then A would equal 10000000,
             B 01000000, C 00100000, etc.  If the bit is not set, the flag is
             not printed.  A flag of 0 is not printed even if the bit position
             is set.  This is to allow reservation of the first bits while
             assigning the last bits.

     <strong>int16</strong>   A signed 16bit integer, 2 bytes.

     <strong>uint16</strong>  An unsigned 16bit integer, 2 bytes.

     <strong>int32</strong>   A signed 32bit integer, 4 bytes.

     <strong>uint32</strong>  An unsigned 32bit integer, 4 bytes.

     <strong>flag</strong>    A fixed value (1) to indicate that the option is present, 0
             bytes.

     <strong>domain</strong>  An RFC 3397 encoded string.

     <strong>dname</strong>   An RFC 1035 validated string.

     <strong>binhex</strong> [: <strong>length</strong>]
             Binary data expressed as hexadecimal.

     <strong>embed</strong>   Contains embedded options (implies encap as well).

     <strong>encap</strong>   Contains encapsulated options (implies embed as well).

     <strong>option</strong>  References an option from the global definition.

   <strong>Example</strong> <strong>definition</strong>
           # DHCP option 81, Fully Qualified Domain Name, RFC 4702
           define 81 embed fqdn
           embed byte flags
           embed byte rcode1
           embed byte rcode2
           embed domain fqdn

           # DHCP option 125, Vendor Specific Information Option, RFC 3925
           define 125 encap vsio
           embed uint32 enterprise_number
           # Options defined for the enterprise number
           encap 1 ipaddress ipaddress

   <strong>Supported</strong> <strong>Authentication</strong> <strong>Protocols</strong>
     <strong>token</strong>    Sends a plain text token the server expects and matches a token
              sent by the server.  The tokens do not have to be the same.  If
              unspecified, the token with a <span class="underline">secretid</span> of 0 will be used in
              sending messages and validating received messages.

     <strong>delayedrealm</strong>
              Delayed Authentication.  <strong>dhcpcd</strong> will send an authentication
              option with no key or MAC.  The server will see this option, and
              select a key for <strong>dhcpcd.conf</strong>, writing the <span class="underline">realm</span> and <span class="underline">secretid</span> in
              it.  <strong>dhcpcd</strong> will then look for an unexpired token with a
              matching <span class="underline">realm</span> and <span class="underline">secretid</span>.  This token is used to authenticate
              all other messages.

     <strong>delayed</strong>  Same as above, but without a realm.

   <strong>Supported</strong> <strong>Authentication</strong> <strong>Algorithms</strong>
     If none specified, <strong>hmac-md5</strong> is the default.

     <strong>hmac-md5</strong>

   <strong>Supported</strong> <strong>Replay</strong> <strong>Detection</strong> <strong>Mechanisms</strong>
     If none specified, <strong>monotonic</strong> is the default.  If this is changed from
     what was previously used, or the means of calculating or storing it is
     broken, then the DHCP server will probably have to have its notion of the
     client's Replay Detection Value reset.

     <strong>monocounter</strong>
              Read the number in the file <span class="underline">/var/db/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-rdm.monotonic</span>
              and add one to it.

     <strong>monotime</strong>
              Create an NTP timestamp from the system time.

     <strong>monotonic</strong>
              Same as <strong>monotime</strong>.
